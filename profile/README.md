# 🛡️ Bagou450 Fixed

> (We are not affiliated with Bagou450 or Pterodactyl panel, but we believe in preserving and securing the work left behind for the benefit of the community.)

**Welcome!**  
We specialize in identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in Pterodactyl addons originally created by Bagou450. Our mission is to provide safe, secure, and maintained versions of popular community tools.

---

## 🔍 What We Do

- **Audit & Remediate**  
  We perform security audits on legacy addons, identify vulnerabilities, and release patched versions.

- **Revive & Maintain Services**  
  Following Bagou450's shutdown in October 2024, we’ve resurrected and now host their API and CDN infrastructure, ensuring uninterrupted service beyond their [August 2025 decommissioning](https://bagou450.com/).

## ⚙️ Current Projects

| Project | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Addons | We’ve forked and enhanced addons such as auto-updaters, server importers, and mod installers from Bagou450’s repo. |
| API & CDN | We host a fully functional mirror of the discontinued Bagou450 API/CDN service slated to shut down in August 2025. |
| Git Patches | Implemening git patches to seamlessly install addons without manual work. |

## 🛠️ Why It Matters

1. **Security First** – Bagou450’s original code had vulnerabilities and has since been deprecated. We provide audited and hardened versions.
2. **Community Support** – We ensure compatibility with latest Pterodactyl versions and continue maintenance where the original project ended.
3. **Continuity of Service** – The Bagou450 API/CDN infrastructure would otherwise go offline by August 2025. We’re keeping it alive.
